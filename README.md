**[2021-02-27]**  
I have realised that Discord plugin development is not for me.
JS is not my favourite language to work in, and I don't know React.
I am changing this repo from BSD-3 to the Unlicense, so if any devs are interested, feel free to take what I've got and finish it.  
I'll still be working on themes though! :)
# Pronouns for Vizality
VZ Pronouns tells you the pronouns that people you interact with use.
It uses [PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org) on the back-end,
so if you want your pronouns to show to users of this plugin, sign up for an account ~~[here](https://pronoundb.org/register)~~ *the login stuff is really dumb and only works when accessed from the main page*.

It is completely written from scratch, so theoretically this can't be DMCA'd like a direct port would.

Sorry Cynthia.
