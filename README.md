# Pronouns for Vizality
VZ Pronouns tells you the pronouns that people you interact with use.
It uses [PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org) on the back-end,
so if you want your pronouns to show to users of this plugin, sign up for an account ~~[here](https://pronoundb.org/register)~~ *the login stuff is really dumb and only works when accessed from the main page*.

It is completely written from scratch, so theoretically this can't be DMCA'd like a direct port would.

Sorry Cynthia.
